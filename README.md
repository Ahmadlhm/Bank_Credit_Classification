# 📊 Bank Credit Classification  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project builds a **machine learning pipeline** to classify bank credit scores based on customer financial data (income, credit score, loan amount, etc.).  

It demonstrates:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values, outliers, class imbalance, and multicollinearity  
- Feature engineering and scaling  
- Training and evaluating multiple classification models (including ensemble methods)  
- Exposing trained models through **APIs** with FastAPI
- An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for EDA, results, and live demo
